# GENERATE ID TO GET GEMINI PRO

**GENERATE ID TO GET GEMINI PRO** is a web-based tool designed to create professional-looking student identity cards instantly. It features a responsive design, live preview, real-time customization, and location-based auto-filling capabilities. This project is built using standard HTML5, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for logic.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Live Preview & Customization**
* **Real-time Updates:** Any change made in the input form (Left Column) is immediately reflected in the ID Card Preview (Right Column).
* **Comprehensive Fields:** Users can customize College Name, Student ID, Email, Mobile, Class, Dates, Address, and Student Name.

### 2. **Smart Automation & Randomization**
* **Auto-Location Detection:** The app attempts to detect the user's location via IP address (using `ipapi.co`) to automatically fill the "Address" field.
* **Country Switcher:** Dedicated buttons to switch context between Bangladesh (BD), India (IN), UK, Nigeria (NG), Pakistan (PK), and Australia (AU).
* **Random Data Generators:** "Pick" or "Generate" buttons for almost every field allow users to quickly populate the card with dummy data for testing.

### 3. **Media Handling**
* **Image Uploads:** Supports uploading custom images for:
    * Student Photo
    * College Logo
    * Principal Signature
* **Placeholder Generators:** Includes buttons to insert random placeholder images if the user doesn't have files ready.

### 4. **Export Functionality**
* **High-Quality Download:** Uses `html2canvas` to capture the DOM element of the ID card and download it as a high-resolution PNG file.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive styling.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic.
* **Libraries:**
    * `html2canvas`: For rendering the HTML element to an image.
    * `FontAwesome`: For UI icons.
    * `Google Fonts`: Typography (Poppins, Dancing Script).

## 📂 Code Structure & Explanation

The file is a Single Page Application (SPA) contained entirely within `index.html`. Here is a breakdown of how the code works:

### 1. HTML Structure
* **`<head>`**: Imports Tailwind, FontAwesome, Google Fonts, and the `html2canvas` library. Contains custom CSS for specific ID card styling (shadows, gradients) and scrollbar customization.
* **`<body>`**:
    * **Left Column (`w-full lg:w-1/2`):** Contains the input form. Each input field has an `oninput="updateCard()"` event listener to trigger real-time updates.
    * **Right Column:** Contains the visual representation of the ID card inside a container (`#idCardPreview`).
    * **Footer:** A styled footer with branding, links, and author information.

### 2. Key JavaScript Functions

#### `detectLocation()`
* **Purpose:** Runs on page load to find the user's city/country.
* **Logic:** Fetches data from `https://ipapi.co/json/`. If successful, it updates the Address field and the country flag indicator.

#### `switchCountry(code)`
* **Purpose:** Manually sets the location context.
* **Logic:** Uses a `countryData` object to look up the City and Country Name based on the code (e.g., 'PK' -> 'Islamabad, Pakistan') and updates the UI accordingly.

#### `updateCard()`
* **Purpose:** The core synchronization engine.
* **Logic:**
    * Reads values from input fields (e.g., `collegeNameInput`).
    * Updates the text content of the corresponding ID card elements (e.g., `cardCollege`).
    * Formats dates (Issue Date / Valid Date) into a `MM/YY` format.

#### `handleImage(input, imgId)`
* **Purpose:** Handles file uploads.
* **Logic:** Uses the `FileReader` API to read the uploaded image file as a Data URL and sets it as the `src` for the target image element on the card.

#### `setRandom(type)`
* **Purpose:** Populates fields with dummy data.
* **Logic:** Uses arrays of predefined strings (names, colleges, signatures) and `Math.random()` to pick one and inject it into the form.

#### `downloadCard()`
* **Purpose:** Exports the card.
* **Logic:**
    1.  Selects the `#idCardPreview` element.
    2.  Uses `html2canvas` to take a "screenshot" of that specific HTML element.
    3.  Creates a temporary `<a>` link with the image data and triggers a click to download the file as a PNG.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Download the `index.html` file.
2.  Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
3.  **Note:** An internet connection is required for the CDN links (Tailwind, FontAwesome, etc.) to load correctly.
